# Salary Prediction with Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository hosts the code and resources for a Salary Prediction project using Multiple Linear Regression. The project aims to predict salaries based on multiple features such as years of experience, education level, and other relevant factors. The model is built using Python's data science libraries and follows the principles of linear regression.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for salary estimation based on various features. Multiple Linear Regression is employed to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables and the dependent variable, which, in this case, is the salary.

## Features

- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Utilizes a linear regression model to predict salaries based on various features.
- **Data Science Libraries:** Built using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Includes Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and visualization of the data.

## Prerequisites
